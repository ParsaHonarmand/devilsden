                <h1>Manchester, City of the Reds...</h1>
                <p>Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Nicknamed "the Red Devils", the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910.</p>

                        <h1>Theatre of Dreams</h1>
                        <p>One Scotsman designed it, another made it legendary. Old Trafford, or rather, "The Theatre of Dreams", as the great Sir Bobby Charlton had renamed it (to which, among other things, the South Stand also bears the former England international's name), is one of the most iconic stadiums in football.
                           Designed by the Scottish architect Archibald Leitch, and inaugurated in 1910, with its nearly 75,000 seats, it is the largest club stadium in the United Kingdom (the second largest of all after Wembley), and the only one to have received a 5-star UEFA award.</p>

                        <h1>Sir Alex Furgeson</h1>
                        <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is the most successful manager in British football history, winning 13 Premier League titles with Manchester United. 
                            He replaced Ron Atkinson at Old Trafford in 1986, winning his first FA Cup in 1990. He also added another UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and UEFA Super Cup to his collection.
                            Ferguson ended Man Utdâ€™s 26-year wait for a top-flight title in the inaugural Premier League season of 1992/93. He went on to enjoy unprecedented success over the next two decades until his retirement at the end of the 2012/13 campaign.
